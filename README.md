# Learning
Being a very unexperienced programmer, I will just randomly blog and add things to this repo I want to learn, or have learned. I will be making small milestones, and seeing where they lead me. I do not plan on fully finishing anything as most of these things may be somewhat ambitious for me, but as long as I come out of the project with a better understanding of something that is a win in my book.
